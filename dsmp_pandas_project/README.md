### Project Overview

 In this project, we work on the Dream Housing Finance Inc. dataset where we try to perform different pandas operations on this dataset to check the percentage of loan approved based on a person's employment type, the percentage of customers whose loan are approved whether self-employed or not, check the average income of an applicant and the average loan given to a person based on their income, to find out those applicants with long loan amount term. We try to clean the data in the dataset by performing the needed operations using pandas on the details of the customers and their features. This dataset includes both categorical and numerical data variables. Loading the data, Filling in missing values and checking the summary statistics of the featurues is done so that this dataset can be ready for ML training.


### Learnings from the project

 After completing this project i learnt that data cleaning is very important before making the dataset available for training.The dataset comes with lot of missing values and null values that should be replaced with values that makes sense. Major work done and learnt in this project was data analysis of the given dataset. It gives an idea about how data analysis can be done on other projects.


### Approach taken to solve the problem

 I tried to solve this problem by first analysing the dataset and its features. Understaning the operations required to perform on the dataset according to the errors in the dataset, and then performing required operations on the dataset.


### Challenges faced

 The biggest challenge was to analyse the raw dataset with missing values which we can overcome using summary statistics. Performimg different pandas operations on the dataset was a bit challenging but it can be tackled easily using documentation.
