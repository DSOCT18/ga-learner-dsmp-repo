### Project Overview

 Armed with new found expertise in regularization, let's work on the Melbourne housing datac to predict the housing prices using regularized regression. Each observation is a different house attribute with various features like the number of properties that exist in the suburb, land size, building size, governing council for the area, real estate agent and price of the house etc.The dataset has details of 6830 house entries with the 16 features


### Learnings from the project

 After completing this project i learned how to build a regularized regression model.I learned that even after applying some regularization methods the performance of prediction was not improving, so we must apply all the regularization techniques to see which technique/model actually improves the perfomance in prediction and check using evaluation metrics. Apply the following concepts:-
• Train-test split
    • Correlation between the features
    • Linear Regression
    • Polynomial Regressor
    • Lasso Regressor
    • Ridge Regressor
    • R2Evaluation Metrics
