### Project Overview

 This is a dataset of  Dream Housing Finance company.Suppose you have been hired by the stakeholders of Dream Housing Finance company to help them get visual insights on the company's operations. There are tasks of visualizing the company's record with respect to loan approvals. Showing the stakeholders the loan approval distribution across the regions. Checking whether the loan approval status is affected by different features of the data such as education.To see if there is correlation between the borrower's income and loan amount he is lent. Using the data visualization techniques you have to help visualise the data and see if you can help the stakeholders arrive at some inference based on the visual plots.


### Learnings from the project

 I learned how to use matplotlib to visualize data effectively and derive good insights from the available data by using technique's like- 
Bar plotting, 
Scatter plotting, 
Kernel Density plotting, 
Subplot operations, 
Axes modifications,.



### Approach taken to solve the problem

 To solve this problem i did step by step plotting of different features in this dataset to get insights from the data. Plotted different columns with the loan amount as well as with the loan approval status and the different type of income to see how the loan distribution is done and based on what factors or features it is done.


### Challenges faced

 The problem was not with the quality of the data (noisy/clean) but that the size of data is too overwhelming to derive any insights.
This is the power of Data visualization. It is an effective way to observe trends, anomalies as well as patterns in the data. More importantly, it is also the one of the simplest and the best communicator for your results. Thus data visualisation is an important tool in the arsenal of a data scientist.
